# 🛠️ Backend Learning Lab


Welcome!  
This is a hands-on learning space for developers new to backend development — especially those coming from frontend or fullstack backgrounds.

You'll use **Golang** to explore real-world backend tools like **MySQL**, **Redis**, **Kafka**, **gRPC**, and **HTTP servers** — in small, focused, runnable projects.

---

## 🔰 Who this is for

- Frontend developers learning how backend systems work
- Devs curious about APIs, databases, caching, and distributed systems
- Anyone who learns best by building real things

---

## 🚀 What You'll Build

Each folder contains a small project with:
- Minimal, working code examples
- Clear README instructions
- Real backend tools and patterns

---

## 🧭 Learning Path

| Step | Folder                | Topic                    | Description                              |
|------|------------------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| 01   | `01-http-server`       | HTTP API                 | Create a basic REST API in Go            |
| 02   | `02-mysql-crud`        | MySQL + CRUD             | Connect Go to MySQL, do basic operations |
| 03   | `03-redis-intro`       | Redis                    | Use Redis for cache and pub/sub          |
| 04   | `04-grpc-basics`       | gRPC                     | Build and call gRPC services             |
| 05   | `05-kafka-streaming`   | Kafka                    | Setup Kafka producer and consumer        |
| 06   | `06-fullstack-demo`    | All combined             | Combine HTTP + DB + Cache + Kafka + gRPC |

## 💡 Philosophy

### 🧱 Unix Philosophy
- **Do one thing, and do it well.**
- Each folder is focused on one specific backend concept or tool.
- By learning small things well, you can combine them confidently later.

### 🔍 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Every file, function, and module has a **clear single purpose**.
- This makes examples easier to follow, debug, and extend.

### 🚫 No Bloated Boilerplate
- Code is kept minimal and practical.
- You see **exactly what matters** without layers of unnecessary abstraction.

### 🚀 Learn by Building
- Build real services, not just Hello World.
- Learn with confidence by breaking and fixing things yourself.
- Every example is designed to be run locally and tested quickly.

---

## ✅ Requirements

- Basic programming knowledge
- Go installed: https://go.dev/doc/install
- Docker installed (recommended for MySQL, Redis, Kafka)

---

## 🧪 How to Start

```bash
cd backend/01-http-server
go run main.go
```

Then visit: http://localhost:8080/hello

Let’s build the backend from first principles — one working piece at a time.

Let me know when you're ready to scaffold `01-http-server` — I can give you code and README for that as well.
