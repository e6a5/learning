# 🔥 Error Handling — Handle Failures Gracefully

**Question**: "How do production systems handle failures gracefully?"

**Hypothesis**: Most failures in production are predictable and recoverable. A robust error handling strategy can transform system crashes into graceful degradations, turning 500 errors into meaningful user feedback and maintaining system reliability even when dependencies fail.

---

## 🧠 What We'll Explore

### 💡 The Problem
Current implementations fail catastrophically:
- Database down → entire server becomes unusable
- Invalid JSON → generic 500 error  
- Network timeouts → silent failures
- Panics → server crashes
- No retry logic → temporary issues become permanent failures

### 🎯 Learning Goals
- **Structured Error Types** — Create meaningful error classifications
- **Graceful Degradation** — Keep systems functional when dependencies fail
- **Circuit Breakers** — Prevent cascade failures
- **Retry Strategies** — Handle transient failures automatically
- **Error Context** — Provide actionable information for debugging
- **Recovery Patterns** — Gracefully handle panics and unexpected states

## 🛠️ Implementation Features

### 🔄 **Error Classification System**
```go
type ErrorType string

const (
    ValidationError    ErrorType = "validation_error"
    DatabaseError     ErrorType = "database_error"
    NetworkError      ErrorType = "network_error"
    AuthenticationError ErrorType = "authentication_error"
    RateLimitError    ErrorType = "rate_limit_error"
    InternalError     ErrorType = "internal_error"
)
```

### 🛡️ **Circuit Breaker Pattern**
- Automatically detect failing services
- Switch to "open" state to prevent cascade failures
- Provide fallback responses during outages
- Self-healing with progressive retry attempts

### 🔄 **Retry Logic with Backoff**
- Exponential backoff for transient failures
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Maximum retry limits with timeout controls
- Dead letter queue for permanent failures

### 📊 **Error Metrics & Observability**
- Error rate tracking by type and endpoint
- Response time percentiles during errors
- Circuit breaker state monitoring
- Failure pattern analysis

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Local Development
```bash
cd backend/07-error-handling
make setup    # Start MySQL, Redis with docker-compose
make run      # Start server locally with error handling
```

### Option 2: Full Docker Stack (Recommended)
```bash
cd backend/07-error-handling
make docker-dev  # Build and run everything with Docker
```

### 3. Test Error Scenarios
```bash
# Test graceful degradation
make test-database-down
make test-redis-down  
make test-error-scenarios
make circuit-status
```

### 4. Access the Application
- **API**: http://localhost:8080
- **Health Check**: http://localhost:8080/health
- **Circuit Breaker Status**: http://localhost:8080/circuit-breaker/status

## 🐳 Docker Usage

### **Build and Run Full Stack**
```bash
make docker-dev          # Build image and start all services
make docker-logs         # View application logs
make docker-stop         # Stop all services
make docker-restart      # Restart with fresh build
```

### **Individual Docker Commands**
```bash
make docker-build        # Build Docker image only
make docker-run          # Run full stack (requires build)
docker compose ps        # Check service status
docker compose down -v   # Clean shutdown with volume removal
```

### **Docker Environment Variables**
The containerized app uses internal Docker networking:
- `DB_DSN=app_user:app_password@tcp(mysql:3306)/error_handling_db`
- `REDIS_ADDR=redis:6379`

---

## 🧪 Error Simulation Endpoints

### **Database Failures**
- `GET /users` → Graceful fallback to cache or default response
- `POST /users` → Queue for later processing when DB recovers

### **Network Timeouts**  
- `GET /external-api` → Circuit breaker with fallback data
- Configurable timeout and retry behavior

### **Validation Errors**
- `POST /users` with invalid data → Structured error response
- Field-level validation with helpful error messages

### **Rate Limiting**
- High-frequency requests → 429 with retry-after headers
- Graceful queuing and backpressure handling

### **Panic Recovery**
- `GET /panic` → Demonstrates panic recovery middleware
- Server continues running after panic

## 📊 Error Response Format

### **Structured Error Response**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "type": "validation_error",
    "code": "INVALID_EMAIL_FORMAT",
    "message": "Email address format is invalid",
    "details": {
      "field": "email",
      "value": "invalid-email",
      "constraint": "must be valid email format"
    },
    "request_id": "req_123456789",
    "timestamp": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z"
  },
  "fallback_data": null
}
```

### **Circuit Breaker Response**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "error": {
    "type": "service_unavailable", 
    "code": "CIRCUIT_BREAKER_OPEN",
    "message": "Database service temporarily unavailable",
    "retry_after": 30,
    "fallback_available": true
  },
  "fallback_data": {
    "cached_users": [...],
    "cache_age": "2 minutes"
  }
}
```
