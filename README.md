## 💡 Philosophy

> *“The best way to learn is to build.”*

This lab follows a few timeless principles:

### 🧱 Unix Philosophy
- **Do one thing, and do it well.**
- Each folder focuses on **a single concept** or technology.
- Tools are **composable**, helping you understand how small things come together to form bigger systems.

### 🔍 Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
- Each file, function, and folder has **one clear purpose**.
- This keeps learning simple and code easy to read, test, and modify.

### 🚫 No Bloated Boilerplate
- No unnecessary abstractions.
- Every example starts from a **minimal, working setup**.
- Complexity is introduced only when necessary and explained clearly.

### 🚀 Learn by Shipping
- You'll **build real, runnable examples** — not just snippets.
- Run the code, break it, fix it, and understand it.
- Each example is **tested and documented** so you can learn quickly and confidently.
